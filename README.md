# Assignment 4 - Logistic Regression & Drift Detection
Enterprise AI, Summer 2025, University of Wuerzburg

## 1. Repository Access
Open the assignment repository using `VS CodeSpace`, as demonstrated in the first tutorial session. When you first run the notebook using this option, please:
- When you run a cell for the first time, select `Install/Enable suggested extensions` and wait a bit for the environment to install all packages in the `requirements.txt` file. You will see this procedure being done automatically in the terminal. 
- Then, a new window will pop up, select `Python Environments... > Python 3.10.12`
- Now you are ready to program! 

Alternatively, if you are comfortable with Git, you may clone the repository locally, complete the assignment on your machine, and push your final solution to the repository.

Please work on the notebook `assignment_4.ipynb` and the Python files in the folder. You can find the instructions on where to write code in the notebook.

## 2. Group Submission
Each group consists of two members. Only **one member per group** needs to submit the final solution.

## 3. Deadline
Submission Deadline: 12 July 2025 at 23:59 (CEST)

Make sure to push your completed work before the deadline.
